Our project analyzes hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab between January 2009 and June 2015. The project also incorporates local historical weather data to examine the impact of weather on the demand for hired-rides.  In data preprocessing part, we removed some invalid data, unnecessary columns, and outliers based on geographic location data. From shp file, we switch the location IDs to longitude and latitude. We also normalized column names and use suitable column types for the respective data. The cleaned data is stored in a SQLite database and used to answer questions through SQL queries and visualizations.  Furthermore, we create several visualizations that help illustrate the trends and insights found in the data analysis. These visualizations include interactive scatterplots and line charts that show how the demand for hired-rides varies over time and in response to weather conditions.
